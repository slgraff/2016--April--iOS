# 00 -- This is Heavy

![BTTF](http://i.giphy.com/KL6leJilrOEVi.gif)

Most of this assignment is getting your laptop ready for Day 1 by installing a few key pieces of software and registering for certain invaluable services like Github and Slack. Beyond that, you'll start to get familiar with Github and basic source control concepts that we'll be using throughout the class. These aren't specific to any language or toolkit; they're universal developer skills.

## Requirements

You will notice in the __Tasks__ and __Requirements__ sections below that the text is a different font and style. It is displayed here without any formatting for easy copy/pasting by you. This checklist uses something called __Markdown__ and provides for really easy formatting. If you copy and paste the text _as is_ from the __Tasks__ and __Deliverables__ sections below into the __Description__ of your issue, you should end up with a bunch of checkboxes, thanks to [the way that Github interprets Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). As you complete tasks, check off the corresponding checkboxes and let your progress bar fill up! Read [Mastering Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) for more information on creating issues in Github.

  * [ ] Your full name, so I can recognize your name.
  * [ ] A valid public email address, so I can contact you if I need to.
* [ ] [Complete the "Hello World" Github guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
  * [ ] Add a link to your new Github repo as a comment on your *WIP Issue*
* [ ] Complete the Code School course [Try Git](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git)
  * [ ] Take a screenshot of the Try Git course when you complete it and add it as a comment to your *WIP Issue*
* [ ] Create a new repository called `TIY-Assignments`
  * [ ] Check the box to create an initial `README.md` file
  * [ ] Select the `CC0` -- "Creative Commons" license for your work
  * [ ] Add a link to your `TIY-Assignments` repo as a comment on your *WIP Issue*
* [ ] Install Xcode from the Mac App Store. Simply search for _Xcode_.
* [ ] Open Xcode. Click the _Xcode_ menu in the menubar, then choose _Preferences_. Navigate to the _Downloads_ tab and install the latest iOS documentation (currently iOS 9.0). Once fully downloaded, the docset should have a small checkmark next to it.

* [ ] Look at the Prework-A file for instructions on how to complete the Counter app.
   * [ ] Your counter app files should be added to your TIY-Assignments repo. Because you previously added a link to your repo to your *WIP Issue*, I will be able to see your progress as you go. Be sure to commit/push the changes you make as you work on the app.

## Extracurricular Activities

Regardless of how good you think you are at typing, a lot of the mistakes you make at first will be simple typographic errors. If you _don't_ know how to touch type (i.e. without looking at the keyboard), start practicing _now_ with http://www.keybr.com/. If you're fairly confident in your typing ability, try working through the Objective-C lessons on http://typing.io

If you've finished everything above and are still looking for more, work through these intro tutorials on the C and Objective-C languages. Objective-C is called a "superset" of ANSI C, meaning that it provides full backwards compatibility with C, and extends it in several important areas. The following tutorials will give you an introduction to several concepts we will use quite heavily in class:

* [Learning C: A Primer](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/learning-c-a-primer--mobile-13916)
* [Getting Started with Objective-C](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-objective-c--mobile-13944)
